# U-NOS-Crick.
**AI-Powered Cricket Simulation 🏏**    Select your dream team, choose a stadium, and let AI simulate the match based on player stats and pitch conditions. AI analyzes performances, probabilities, and historical data to generate realistic results.Currently in beta. 🚀Friendly and easy to setup onky need any code editor! extensions are optional.

This is a game where you can choose your favorite cricket players and create your own playing XI. Once both players have selected their teams, AI will analyze them.  

AI will analyze the match in the following way:  

1. First, it will take all the inputs.  
2. Then, it will process these inputs and aim for a result using multiple possibilities and combinations.  
3. During this process, several possibilities arise, such as:  
   - The type of pitch being used.  
   - A player's past performance on that pitch.  
   - If a stadium was built after a player retired, then usual pitch stats will be considered, and the player’s average will be calculated.  
   - This data will then be passed through a training and testing model.  
   - You can imagine endless possibilities and combinations, leading to a final decision that determines the scores, depending on the API or a custom-trained model.  
4. This is India’s only game model where we see AI interference and realistic winning possibilities.  
5. The outcome depends on how well the model is trained. Currently, it is in its beta stage.  
6. Enjoy the game!
